I'm a first year astronomy PhD student supervised by Professor Andrew Norton, Dr Ulrich Kolb, and Dr Hugh Dickinson at the Open University. I'm working on the [SuperWASP Variable Stars](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ajnorton/superwasp-variable-stars) project on the Zooniverse.

My research interests include astrophysical transients, time-domain astronomy, and applications of machine learning to the classification of astronomical data.
