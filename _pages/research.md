I'm an astronomer at the University of Southampton, mainly working on classifying light curves using citizen science. I run two Zooniverse citizen science projects: [Black Hole Hunters](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/cobalt-lensing/black-hole-hunters), which is searching for black holes in self-lensing binaries; and [SuperWASP Variable Stars](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ajnorton/superwasp-variable-stars), which is cataloguing variable stars in the archives of the SuperWASP all-sky survey.

My research interests include astrophysical transients, time-domain astronomy, and applications of machine learning to the classification of astronomical data.
