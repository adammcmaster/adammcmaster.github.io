I'm an experienced programmer with a background in building websites and web services, and related tools. You can find some of my code on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/adammcmaster). Here are a few notable examples:

* [zooniverse/panoptes-python-client](https://github.com/zooniverse/panoptes-python-client) -- I created a Python API client for [the Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), which is used by researchers to manage their citizen science projects.
* [zooniverse/panoptes-cli](https://github.com/zooniverse/panoptes-cli) -- A Zooniverse command-line interface, based on the above Python package.
* [ou-escape-eco/vespa](https://github.com/ou-escape-eco/vespa) -- A Django-based website (in progress) to publish results from the [SuperWASP Variable Stars project](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ajnorton/superwasp-variable-stars).
