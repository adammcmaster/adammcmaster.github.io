As part of the Open University's first year "upgrade" process (i.e. their probation process) I gave an internal talk about what I've been working on. This includes some video demos of [VeSPA](https://github.com/ou-escape-eco/vespa), the upcoming SuperWASP variable star catalogue.

Here's a video version of the slideshow that includes the demos:
