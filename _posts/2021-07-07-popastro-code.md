I'm a little late in posting this, but I recently wrote an article for [Popular Astronomy](https://www.popastro.com/main_spa1/about-the-spa/our-lively-magazine-popular-astronomy/). It's for the Young Stargazers section, and in it I encourage students who are considering studying astronomy to learn how to write code:

It's not available online, but you can find it in the May-June 2021 issue in print.
