title: Why You Should Use Docker in Your Research
Date: July 17, 2018

I gave a talk at the [Wetton Workshop](https://wetton.web.ox.ac.uk/) in Oxford
in June, and then wrote a [blog version of that for the Zooniverse
blog](https://blog.zooniverse.org/2018/07/17/why-you-should-use-docker-in-your-research/):

> Last month I gave a talk at the Wetton Workshop in Oxford. Unlike the other
> talks that week, mine wasn’t about astronomy. I was talking about Docker – a
> useful tool which has become popular among people who run web services. We use
> it for practically everything here, and it’s pretty clear that researchers
> would find it useful if only more of them used it. That’s especially true in
> fields like astronomy, where a lot of people write their own code to process
> and analyse their data. If after reading this post you think you’d like to
> give Docker a try and you’d like some help getting started, just get in touch
> and I’ll be happy to help.
