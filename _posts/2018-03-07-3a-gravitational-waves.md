A post about the [different types of gravitational
waves](https://three-alpha.space/not-all-gravitational-waves-start-with-a-bang/)
and where they come from, on my new blog, Three Alpha:

> You’ve probably heard of gravitational waves. They’ve been in the news a lot
> recently because of two experiments called LIGO and Virgo, which have detected
> gravitational waves coming from some of the most violent events in the
> Universe – black holes merging and an enormous explosion known as a kilonova.
> But did you know there are other kinds of gravitational waves which haven’t
> been detected yet and which don’t start out so spectacularly?
