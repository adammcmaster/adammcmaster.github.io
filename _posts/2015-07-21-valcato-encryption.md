I wrote a post on the Valcato blog [outlining
why](http://blog.valcato.com/2015/we-support-the-right-to-encrypt/), as a
company, we oppose the Snoopers' Charter and support our clients' right to
encrypt their communications.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

> The UK government is pressing ahead with plans to introduce legislation this
> year which will ban the use of encrypted communications, the contents of which
> can not be viewed by the security services. Undoubtedly terrorists and other
> criminals who use encrypted communications stand a better chance of evading
> state surveillance than those who don’t. However, the suggestion that this is
> a good reason to ban service providers from properly securing communications

The Open Rights Group have a
[petition](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/dont-let-the-snoopers-charter-bounce-back)
opposing the bill.
