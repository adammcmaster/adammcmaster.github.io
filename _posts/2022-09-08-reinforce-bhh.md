Last week I gave an update on the [Black Hole Hunters](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hughdickinson/superwasp-black-hole-hunters) project to the [REINFORCE](https://reinforceeu.eu/) workshop, [Fostering citizensâ€™ role in the advance of ground-breaking research in fundamental physics](https://indico.ego-gw.it/event/467/). Just in time for my talk, the project reached 2 million classifications on the Zooniverse! I'm currently working on building the analysis pipeline to see what the Zooniverse volunteers have found.
