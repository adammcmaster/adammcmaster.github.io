The new [SuperWASP.org](https://www.superwasp.org) is now live. It contains a section called [VeSPA: The Variable Star Photometry Archive](https://www.superwasp.org/vespa/) which I've spent the last few months building. The archive contains the first results from the [SuperWASP Variable Stars](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ajnorton/superwasp-variable-stars) Zooniverse project

The [code behind VeSPA is available on GitHub](https://github.com/ou-escape-eco/vespa).

I presented a couple of conference posters about VeSPA last month, one at the European Astronomical Society Meeting and one at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting. [A PDF of the NAM poster](/assets/slides/2021-NAM.pdf) is available. I also made a third poster for a competition at the Open University, which you can [view on the OU website](http://oro.open.ac.uk/77353/).
