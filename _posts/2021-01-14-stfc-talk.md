I gave a student lightning talk at this week's STFC Introductory Course, where I gave a brief overview of the [SuperWASP Variable Stars](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ajnorton/superwasp-variable-stars) project and the online [variable star catalogue](https://github.com/ou-escape-eco/vespa) I'm building.

[A PDF of the slides](/assets/slides/2021-stfc-lightning-superwasp.pdf) is available.
