This week was the SEPnet student-led conference, [The Imitation Game](https://sdasrc.wixsite.com/bridgingastronomy), at The Open University.

As well as being a member of the organising committee, I presented an early look at the results from [Black Hole Hunters](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hughdickinson/superwasp-black-hole-hunters) -- [a PDF of the slides](/assets/slides/2023-sepnet-bhh.pdf) is available. Work on the analysis pipeline is going well and there should hopefully be a paper out with the final results later this year.
