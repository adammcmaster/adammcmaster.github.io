I hosted a discussion and Q&A about [Black Hole Hunters](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/hughdickinson/superwasp-black-hole-hunters), citizen science, and the "big data" revolution in astronomy, as part of [British Science Week](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/across-the-sciences/british-science-week). We encouraged the audience to submit classifications via the Zooniverse, and they submitted over 7,000 during the event and 14,000 during the whole day.

The recording of the event is below:
