I wrote an [article for The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/gaia-mission-five-insights-astronomers-could-glean-from-its-latest-data-184773) about the recent Gaia Data Release 3 (along with Andrew Norton) summarising my favourite highlights from the new data:

> The European Space Agency’s (Esa) Gaia mission has just released new data. The Gaia satellite was launched in 2013, with the aim of measuring the precise positions of a billion stars. In addition to measuring the stars’ positions, speeds and brightness, the satellite has collected data on a huge range of other objects.
