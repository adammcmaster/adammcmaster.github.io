Last week I attended NAM 2022 at the University of Warwick. I presented my poster, _[Black Hole Hunters: A citizen science search for black hole self-lensing](/assets/slides/2022-NAM.pdf)_. The Royal Astronomical Society also [put out a press release about the project](https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/news/black-hole-hunters-citizen-science-search-black-hole-self-lensing):

> A research team from the Open University and the University of Southampton is asking for the public’s help to find some of the most mysterious, elusive objects in the Universe – black holes. By examining data from the SuperWASP survey, the UK's leading extra-solar planet detection programme, the team hope to detect changes in starlight that may provide evidence for the existence of these black holes.
