title: Stargazing Live 2017 Recap
---

I wrote a [summary of our experience at Stargazing Live this
year](https://blog.zooniverse.org/2017/05/10/stargazing-live-2017-recap/) – the
first time we've managed to run a BBC Stargazing Live event at the Zooniverse
with no major technical issues even under peak load, and also the first run for
ABC Stargazing Live in Australia:

> We recently had a very successful (and longer than usual) Stargazing Live. I
> wanted to talk a little about the work that our team did in the weeks leading
> up to this and also recap what actually happened behind the scenes during the
> two weeks of events.
